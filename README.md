# AI Mass Feedback

Using [AgentMail](agentmail.to), this is an AI-agent to survey groups of people.
Look at `ex.md` for an example of what using this agent would look like.

Features:
- Runs with purely local LLMs(tested with qwen2.5-7b)
- Configurable with various MCP servers to enhance queries, interfaces with mcphost(could be configured with Claude Desktop)

WIP:
- scaling agent to larger email lists
- granular responses about attributing data
